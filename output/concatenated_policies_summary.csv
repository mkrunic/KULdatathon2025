This work will include consultation on whether mandating an electric vehicle plug type could improve the consistency of public charging. The strategy will build on grants from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), finance from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and the current work of the COAG Transport and Infrastructure Council.

Companies and non-profit organisations which develop a mobility action plan in order to support a significant modal shift among their employees can get 50% funding of these initiatives from the ""commuterfund"" during the first 4 years. In each Flemish province a mobility desk was created, where companies can get assistance and advice on the development of their commuter plans. In addition, companies pay back at least 56-64.9% of the cost of a public transport season ticket to their employees.

The regulation sets out high-performance benchmarks or enables the director to set facility-specific product benchmarks. To meet the emissions reduction requirement, facilities can reduce their emissions or use emission performance credits, emission offsets or pay into the regulated fund. Regulated facilities must provide annual compliance reports and facilities that emit more than 1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide must also provide a yearly forecasting report.

After that, gradually other industry sectors, such as cement, steel, petroleum refining and chemicals will be added to the program. The ETS targets is not an absolute emissions gap, but a rate based (CO2/Kwh) cap that is set per category per sector. The rate is based on historical trends and technology benchmarks (Stavins, 2017). For example, coal-fired power plants are expected to have different rates, than gas-fired power plants.

The main measures are: 1) As of January 1st 2011, electricity generators from both special and ordinary regimes will be required to pay a fee of a value equal to EUR 0.50/MWh for electricity fed into the grid. 2) As already witnessed for wind and thermal power installations, the number of equivalent hours of solar photovolatic generated electricity eligible for government support is limited. Once that limit is reached, the excess electricity generated by that particular installation during that particular year will not be supported and will be sold at the wholesale electricity market price. Between 2011 and 2013, the share of equivalent hours will remain as established in the Renewable Energy Plan 2005-2010 and concerned power stations will then enjoy three extra years of Government support, scaling up the support period from 25 to 28 years.

The goal highligted in the version submitted to the UNFCCC in April 2017 is to cut 40% of GHG emissions by 2030 and 75% by 2050, with a 1990 baseline. Regarding sectoral policies, the document highlights several goals. ""In the transport sector, the SNBC aims to achieve a 29% reduction in emissions over the 2015-2028 period, notably by improving the energy efficiency of vehicles consuming 2 litres per 100km and developing clean vehicles (electric cars, biofuels, etc.). In agriculture, the SNBC aims to achieve a 12% reduction in emissions through the implementation of the agroecology project. This will involve methanisation, ground cover, maintaining pastureland, developing the agroforestry sector and optimising the use of inputs. In the industrial sector, the SNBC aims to achieve a 24% emissions reduction, notably by improving energy efficiency, which is also a source of competitiveness, growing the circular economy (reuse, recycling, energy recovery, etc.) and replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. In the waste management sector, the SNBC aims to achieve a 33% reduction in emissions, by reducing food waste, developing the concept of eco-design, fighting planned obsolescence, promoting reuse and improving waste recovery efforts.""

The RUPTL prioritises the use of renewable energy sources, as well as domestic use of gas, and serves as the basis for state-owned electricity company, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), to meet Indonesia’s projected energy needs. In terms of electricity, IPPs are allocated power projects to deliver a total of 33,666 MW, while state-owned PLN is slated to build power plants delivering approximately 16,243 MW. Coal is projected to account for 54 per cent of Indonesia’s electricity production, renewables 23 per cent, gas 22 per cent and fuel the balance. The largest share of renewables goes to hydro/mini-hydro (9.7GW), followed by geothermal (4.6 GW). Rooftop solar photovoltaic is projected at 3,200 MW. (Nuclear power considered.) To reach 100% electrication, the Plan seems to point at the importance of decentralized renewable solutions. The EV industry is also taken into account, with the PLN developing a national standard for EV charging specifications and preparing a roadmap to prepare for the installation of charging stations.

The state targets the installation of 1 to 1.2 GW of solar capacity by 2022, seeks to enhance energy security, create jobs in the solar manufacturing and become a main exporter of renewable power to third party and neighboring states. To reach such targets, the solar policy includes a combination of support tools: First, power producers are exempted from electricity duty on the energy they consume and can apply for incentives under the Industry Scheme. Producers of solar thermal energy are granted access to the water quantity required for generation by local authorities and solar power will be guaranteed grid access under both the Indian Solar Mission and the Rajasthan Solar policy. The solar policy seeks to widespread the installation of solar water heating systems on all industrial buildings where hot water is required, large residential buildings, government and private hospitals, hotels and swimming pools. Solar steam systems in residential institutions and hospitals will also be supported. Second, the solar policy creates the RE infrastructure Development Fund to finance transmission network extension, road construction and ease the integration of RE generation. Such Fund will be financed by the collection of a development charge of INR. 10 Lacs per MW installed transfered to the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation. The policy also provides for the regulation framework to develop solar parks larger than 1, 000 MW capacity. Such Parks will include Solar Power Plants, Manufacturing Zones, R & D and Training Centres. Third, the Solar Policy creates the Solar Research Center of excellence. The solar policy will fulfill Rajasthan s engagements in the National Solar Mission -install 66 MW of solar capacity- and install additional capacity following a competitive bidding process. Central government will tender 50 MW of solar PV and 50 MW of solar thermal and best bidders will be guaranteed a fixed price by Discoms of Rajasthan. Moreover, the policy will promote the installation of solar PV and solar thermal plans for direct sale to Discoms of Rajasthan with a maximum capacity of 200 MW by 2013 and an additional 400 MW by 2017. Eligible projects will also be selected through auctions. The state will promote off grid and decentralised solar applications and hybrid systems in replacement of diesel based generators. The solar policy also facilitates the installation of solar power producers targeting solar power trade with third party or other states. In fact, Rajasthan aims to become a major issuer of solar Renewable Energy Certificates within the Indian Renewable Portfolio Obligation.

(Objectives, NPCC 2010). The plan does highlight specific thrust areas to ""ST1-P1: Facilitate the harmonisation of existing policies to address climate change adaptation and mitigation in a balanced manner. ST2-P1: Institute measures to make development climate-resilient through low carbon economy to enhance global competitiveness and attain environmentally sustainable socio-economic growth.

The country also has a Cabinet Committee of Climate Change and a National Steering Committee of Climate change. The country has a policy on climate change but does not specifically meets our criteria of ""states in its title and/or in its statement of objectives limiting or reduce GHG emissions"".

The goal would be reached through a combination of expanding carbon capture and storage and buying emission credits internationally. Mr Stoltenberg declared two further targets: Norway would exceed its Kyoto protocol target by ten percentage points and unilaterally cut emissions by 30% compared to 1990 levels by 2020. Norways Kyoto target is to restrict emission rises to 1% above 1990 levels during 2008-2012.

Particular emphasis was put on outlining a proposal for a broad domestic emissions trading system covering about 80% of the emissions from 2008, to be compatible with the international emissions trading system under the Kyoto Protocol. The system is based on the recommendations of the commission of experts appointed to devise an emissions trading system, although final decisions have not been made on all the issues discussed by the commission. As a general rule, the emissions quotas should be sold, but in order to avoid carbon leakage, it may be necessary to provide quotas free of charge for some industries for a limited period of time.

The Norwegian Domestic Emissions Trading Scheme ran from 2005-07, and generally aligned itself with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, covering only CO2 emissions. Industrial CO2 emitters are allocated a total amount of emissions, and reducing emissions generates credits which can be sold to other emitters needing more. The Scheme covered CO2 emissions from energy use and some industrial processes, and only covered installations not subject to the CO2 Tax (see separate entry) or special agreements on emissions reductions with the State Pollution Control Authority. According to this agreement, existing process industry plants agreed to commit themselves to a 20% reduction in all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2007, compared to 1990 levels.

The initiative offers assistance in the form of lenient loans. The funding period covers the years 2015 through 2020. It primarily targets business owners and enables borrowing with a low interest rate to pay for up to 85% of investment costs. The Stork Program encourages the development, enlargement, and renovation of renewable energy facilities. The BOCIAN program is scheduled to run from 2015 until 2023.

After going through two amendments, the new law became effective in July 2016. The Law substitutes an auction system for the green certificate system. The first auction was held on December 30, 2016, and the results were released in early January 2017. Additional auctions were held in the spring of 2017, and more were planned for the summer and the fall. The Act was unclear about whether combining an auction contract with other forms of public funding would violate the EU's standards on fair competition, therefore the final two 2017 auction rounds were annulled. These errors served as the impetus for the following revision to the Act, which became effective on June 29, 2018. The auction system was amended by the June 2018 legislation, which also effectively unblocked it. To add new renewable energy capacity to the system, the Energy Regulatory Office (URE) of Poland is required to plan and conduct auction rounds by the end of 2018 and early 2019. Auction technology baskets were updated by the June 2018 modification.

resulting from specific energy saving interventions in the mining sector(Department of Energy, 2016b). For comparison, the mining and quarrying sector’s energy use amounted to 185 PJ in 2015 (IEA, 2017a). Total final energy consumption of the industry sector is expected to be reduced by15%by 2030 below2015levels by the implementation of efficiency measures.
