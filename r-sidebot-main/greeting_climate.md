You can use this sidebar to filter and sort the data based on the columns available in the `climate_policies` table. Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can ask me:

1. Filtering: "Show me climate policy information about Belgium."
2. Sorting: "Show all countries sorted by carbon emission policy scores."
3. Answer questions about the data: "What country has the highest renewable energy policy score?"

You can also say "Show me the original table" to clear the current filter/sort, or "Help" for more usage tips.
