## 🏗️ Project Structure

### **Part 1: Dashboard for Interactive Data Exploration**
- **Policy Summarization**: Uses `facebook/bart-large-cnn` to summarize policies.
- **Policy Embeddings**: Utilizes `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to generate policy text embeddings, visualized on an interactive plot.
- **Zero-Shot Topic Classification**: Employs `facebook/bart-large-mnli` for topic assignment without labeled training data.

### **Part 2: Chatbot for Data Exploration**
- **Interactive Exploration**: Enables users to query and navigate the dataset.
- **Automated Statistical Analysis**: Runs advanced queries and statistical insights on climate policies.

### **Part 3 (In Progress): TinyTroop Agents**
- **Country-Specific Consultant Agents**: AI-powered advisors trained on climate policy and real-world data.
- **AI-Powered Conferences**: Simulate international negotiations using AI agents.
- **Policy Feedback System**: Evaluate existing policies and suggest improvements.
- **Impact Optimization**: Maximize the effectiveness of climate actions using both policy insights and real data.

## How It Works
1. **Data Ingestion**: We collect climate policies, climate impact reports, and country-specific environmental data.
2. **Policy Summarization & Embeddings**: Policies are summarized using LLMs, and embeddings are created to reveal structural relationships.
3. **TinyTroop AI Agents**: Each agent is fine-tuned on its country’s policy corpus and learns from global climate data.
4. **Interactive Platform**: Users can explore climate policy trends, receive AI-driven feedback, and simulate policy negotiations.
5. **Optimized Policy Decision-Making**: AI finds solutions that maximize both national and global policy efficacy.


## 🎯 Future Development
🔹 **Advanced TinyTroop Capabilities**: Improve AI reasoning for deeper policy analysis.
🔹 **Expanded Policy Dataset**: Incorporate real-time updates from global climate reports.
🔹 **Decision Impact Prediction**: Model how policies influence real-world climate metrics.
🔹 **Enhanced Conference Simulations**: Train AI agents to negotiate optimal climate agreements.
