The RUPTL prioritises the use of renewable energy sources, as well as domestic use of gas, and serves as the basis for state-owned electricity company, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), to meet Indonesia’s projected energy needs. In terms of electricity, IPPs are allocated power projects to deliver a total of 33,666 MW, while state-owned PLN is slated to build power plants delivering approximately 16,243 MW. Coal is projected to account for 54 per cent of Indonesia’s electricity production, renewables 23 per cent, gas 22 per cent and fuel the balance. The largest share of renewables goes to hydro/mini-hydro (9.7GW), followed by geothermal (4.6 GW). Rooftop solar photovoltaic is projected at 3,200 MW. (Nuclear power considered.) To reach 100% electrication, the Plan seems to point at the importance of decentralized renewable solutions. The EV industry is also taken into account, with the PLN developing a national standard for EV charging specifications and preparing a roadmap to prepare for the installation of charging stations.
